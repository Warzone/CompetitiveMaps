# CompetitiveMaps

This repository contains competitive (also known as "ranked") maps used by Warzone on past, current, or future tournaments.
Warzone does not aim to host or manage automated "ranked" matches, nor does it have a separate division for such purpose. Maps hosted in this repository are or will be used exclusively for tournaments.

Most (if not all) maps in this repository are provided publicly by [MCResourcePile](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/) or [Overcast Community](https://github.com/OvercastCommunity/scrimmage-maps). Kudos to them for hosting and maintaining these maps.

## Licensing and commercial use

Every map folder in this repository should contain a `LICENSE.txt` or `USAGE.txt` file.
- A `LICENSE` will most likely be a [CC BY-SA 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), which allows for commercial use of the map. However, there are some exceptions. Please make sure to carefully read the `LICENSE` file before using a map. Any map with a non-commercial license in this repo is used and provided under the explicit permission of its author(s).
- A `USAGE` notice will usually indicate where the original map files can be found (or were extracted from), as well as who to contact for permission to use the map commercially. Any map with such notice is, once again, used and provided under the permission of its author(s).

Contact a Warzone map developer for more information on licensing, commercial use, or privately hosted maps.
